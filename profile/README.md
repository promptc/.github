# ‚öôÔ∏è ***promptc*** - *A Brand New Specification for Prompt Engineering*

**promptc** is a project that aims to help developers write better prompts,
and make prompts **_'prompt once, run everywhere'_**.

We provide a specification called `promptc`, which allows engineers to write
prompts using a **standardised & structured** format that can be easily used
across multiple programming languages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with `promptc`, you can view [promptc-go](https://github.com/promptc/promptc-go).
It gives a brief view of `promptc` standard & provides a powerful cli tool
which could help you try `promptc` more easier.

‚ö†Ô∏è _Multiple Programming Languages Support (MPLS)_ is still on the way!

## üöß What's next?

### üèÉ Stablisation

We will try our best stableise `promptc-go` and then make the `promptc` available
in multiple programming languages (MPLS)!

### üì¶ Pot - Yet Another Prompt Management Tool (Prompt OJBK Tool)

We are also building an *npm*-like service called pot,
which will help users manage their prompts.

With pot, you can easily manage your prompts and share them with others.

You can also use pot to search for existing prompts and download them for use in your own projects.
